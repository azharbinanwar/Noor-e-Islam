 * Ship defaults for prayer calculation — the values a brand-new user gets before touching Settings.

 * Read ONLY by the Miqat engine, as the fallback when Prefs has no saved value (`Prefs.x ?: MiqatDefaults.x`).
 * Prefs (storage) must NOT import this — it stays domain-free and returns null when unset. Keeping the default
 * here (not seeded into Prefs at launch) means a future app update can improve a default and it still reaches
 * every user who never overrode it.
